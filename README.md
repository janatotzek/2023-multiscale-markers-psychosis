# 2023-multiscale-markers-psychosis

This notebook describes the processing steps that were performed for the z-score Subtype and Stage Inference analysis of the article 
"Longitudinal Inference of Multiscale Markers of Psychosis: From Hippocampal Centraliy to Functional Outcome" (Totzek et al., accepted, Molecular Psychiatry). The preprint is available here: https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/3d54u 

In this notebook it is assumed that input measures for the calculation of hippocampal centrality (see Participation_Coefficient.ipynb) have previously been derived.

For code about the processing steps prior to calculating hippocampal centrality, as described in the methods section of the manuscript,
