# 2023-multiscale-markers-psychosis

This notebook describes the processing steps that were performed for the z-score Subtype and Stage Inference analysis of the article 
"Longitudinal Inference of Multiscale Markers of Psychosis: From Hippocampal Centraliy to Functional Outcome" (Totzek et al., submitted).
In this notebook it is assumed that all measures (i.e., hippocampal centrality) have previously been derived.

For code about the processing steps for hippocampal centrality, as described in the methods section of the manuscript,
